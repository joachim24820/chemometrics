Data handling

#ways of 'fixing' the data if it contained missing values, also types of missing data
MCAR
MAR
MNAR

#preprocessing
3 types of values, converting to comatible values for math -> dummy values

Standardizing -> center and scale data before making model
what / how (also in later lecture)
centering: remove avg
Same look, centered on 0

scaling: remove unit, average/stddev
limits are scaled (up/down), does not change distribution

#after making model
"Model 1" book 13-16 -> what happened here?

#Cheking the model: R^2 and MSE ((root)mean squared value(?))
R^2: our model compared to avg value , = 0 means model is as good or bad as using the avg (model values are equal to avg)
R^2 = 0.8 = good model
